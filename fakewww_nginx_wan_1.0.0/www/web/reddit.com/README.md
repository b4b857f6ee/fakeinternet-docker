# Quick Description

Redesign the list/home page of Reddit as a part of Web Design Decal from Fall 2015 curriculum. 
Overall, implemented a flat UI and simplified the home page for a pursuit of a smoother experience.

# Purpose Behind the Design

Reddit has primarily an interface problem with the design reminiscent of the 1990s.
Essentially, there is "too much going on" for an entertainment/news website. 
For a text-heavy interface, it is crucial to simplify the page so that users do not have to be distracted by the chaotic colors 
(as in usage of too much color ranging from grey, orange, to multiple shades of blue). 
My design utilizes primarily neutral colors as well as two highlight colors of orange and blue that is found of the original home page
so that the redesign does not lose its original identity. 
The fact is, the UX aspect of Reddit is not so bad - however, due to its poor user interface, one would misinterpret the UX aspect of the site to be poor.
By mending the issue of its user interface, users should theoretically have a better experience overall - a goal any website should aim for.
